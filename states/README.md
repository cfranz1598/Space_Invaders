# Space_invaders


Yes, the video game popular in every bar in America in the 70s and 80s.

This started from a YouTube tutorial by 'Clear Code' and the vast majority of the credit for this 'masterpiece' remains with him:

Check him out.  He has a good teaching style.

I found some minor things which could be upgraded with it.  It ends abruptly, coding style, and smoe 'fragile' code.  Added some features to make it less.. abrupt. Not sure if I imporved the things I found 'fragile'... you be the judge.  I've got another version coming up with a splash screen, menu, etc.

Please let me know of any bugs or things I screwed up.  I'm way to old and experienced to have any ego issues with my code.

I hope you enjoy.
